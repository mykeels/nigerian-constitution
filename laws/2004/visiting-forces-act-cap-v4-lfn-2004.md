4.         Restriction of right to try members of visiting forces

(b)       in a case where paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply, a service court or service authority of the sending country shall not try him or deal with him summarily for that offence unless before the commencement of the trial or summary proceedings, the Minister has issued a certificate stating that it is not proposed to deal with the case under Nigerian law.

(2)       Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section applies—

(a)       where the alleged offence, if committed by the accused, arose out of and in the course of his duty as a member of the visiting force of which he was a member at the material time;

(b)       where the alleged offence is an offence against the person, and the person or, if more than one, each of the persons in relation to whom it is alleged to have been committed was at the material time either—

(i)        a member of the same or any other visiting force of the sending country of the accused; or

(ii)       a dependant of a member of any such visiting force;

(c)       where the alleged offence is an offence against property, and the whole of the property in relation to which it is alleged  to have been committed (or, if different parts of that property were differently owned, each part of it) was at the material time the property of one of the following, that is to say—

(i)        the sending country of the accused or an authority of that country; or

(ii)       a member of the same or any other visiting force of the sending country of the accused; or

(iii)      a dependant of a member of any such visiting force;

(d)       where the alleged offence is an offence against the security of the sending country of the accused.

(3)       Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section—

(b)       shall, after the conclusion of a trial, be treated as having affected the validity of the trial if no such objection was made in the proceedings at any stage before the conclusion of the trial.

(4)       Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this section, where, in the exercise of the powers mentioned in section 2 (1) of this Act, a person has been tried by a service court of a country to which this section applies, he shall not be tried for the same crime by a Nigerian court.

(5)       In relation to cases where the charge (by whatever words expressed) is a charge of attempting or conspiring to commit an offence, or of aiding, abetting, procuring or being accessory to the commission of an offence, paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (2) of this section shall have effect as if references therein to the alleged offence were references to the offence which the accused is alleged to have attempted or conspired to commit or (as the case may be) the offence as regards which it is alleged that he aided, abetted, procured or was accessory to the commission thereof; and references in those paragraphs to persons in relation to whom, or property in relation to which, the offence is alleged to have been committed, shall be construed accordingly.

(2)       The powers conferred by the said sections 241 to 243 and 245, as applied by the foregoing subsection, shall not be exercised in relation to a person except in compliance with a request (whether specific or general) of the appropriate authority of the country to which he belongs.

(3)       In sections 242, 243 and 245 of the Armed Forces of Nigeria Act, as applied by subsection (1) of this section, references to the delivery of a person into military custody shall be construed as references to the handing over of that person to such authority of the country to which he belongs, and at such place in Nigeria, as may be designated by the appropriate authority of that country.

(4)       For the purposes of any proceedings under or arising out of any provision of the Armed Forces Act as applied by the foregoing provisions of this section—

(a)       a certificate issued by or on behalf of the Minister, stating that a request has been made for the exercise of the powers mentioned in subsection (2) of this section and indicating the effect of the request, shall be sufficient evidence, unless the contrary is proved, of the facts stated therein;

(b)       a certificate issued by the officer commanding a unit or detachment of any of the forces of a country to which this section applies, stating that a person named and described therein was at the date of the  certificate a deserter or absentee without leave from those forces, shall be sufficient evidence, unless the contrary is proved, of the facts stated therein.

(5)       References in this section to the country to which a person belongs are references to the country from whose forces he is suspected of being, or (where he has surrendered himself) appears from his confession to be, a deserter or absentee without leave.

(2)       A person in respect of whom a warrant has been issued under this section may, in accordance therewith, be detained by any Nigerian service authority in like manner as if he were a member of the home forces liable to be        detained in custody in pursuance of a corresponding sentence passed by a Nigerian service court.

(3)       For the purposes of any proceedings arising out of the foregoing provisions of this section, a certificate issued by or on behalf of the Minister, stating that a request has been made for the issue of a warrant under this section in respect of a person named in the certificate shall be sufficient evidence, unless the contrary is proved, of the facts stated therein.
