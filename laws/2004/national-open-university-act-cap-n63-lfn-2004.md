(1)      Subject to the provisions of this section, where it appears to the Vice-Chancellor that any student of the University has been guilty  of misconduct, the Vice-Chancellor may, without prejudice to any other disciplinary powers conferred on him by statute or regulations, direct—

(a)      that the student shall not, during such period as may be specified in the direction, participate in such activities of the University or make use of such facilities of the University as may be so specified; or

(b)      that the activities of the student shall, during such period as may be specified in the direction, be restricted in such manner as may be so specified; or

(c)       that the student be expelled from the University.

(3)      The fact that an appeal against a direction is brought in pursuance of the last foregoing subsection, shall not affect the question of the direction while the appeal is pending.

(4)      The Vice-Chancellor may delegate his powers under this section to a disciplinary board consisting of such members of the University as he may nominate.
