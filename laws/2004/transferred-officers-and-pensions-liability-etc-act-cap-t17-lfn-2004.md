If, before the making of this Act, an officer had been assigned, by any authority having power to do so, to perform the duties of any office in the service of the Interim Common Services Agency, the officer shall, with effect from such date as the Commission may determine (not earlier in any event than the date on which the officer was so assigned) be deemed-

Provided that new terms and conditions of service subsequently brought into force with respect to the public service to which an officer is so transferred, being terms and conditions that are applicable in his case, shall apply to him.

(2)    If, on or after the appointed day, an officer retires from the public service of a former Region by reason of the fact that he has not, on or after that date, accepted appointment in any other office in any public service in the Federation or, as the case may be, in any office in any approved service, within the meaning of the Pensions Act, that officer shall not, by reason only of so retiring, be entitled to any pension or gratuity or other like benefit (other than such as may be granted under any pensions enactment or under his contract of service, as the case may be).
