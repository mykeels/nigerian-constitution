The net surplus revenue recoverable from an oil marketing company under this Act shall be calculated by reference to the volume of the affected products sold on zonal basis and to the amount by which the uniform prices at which the products were sold exceeded, or were less than, the prices of those products prevailing immediately before the fixing of the uniform prices of the products.
