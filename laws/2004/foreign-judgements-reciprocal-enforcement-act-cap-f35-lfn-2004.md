(iv)   that the judgment was obtained by fraud; or

(v)    that the enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to public policy in Nigeria; or

(vi)   that the rights under the judgment are not vested in the person by whom the application for registration was made;

(2)    For the purposes of this section the courts of the country of the original court shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, be deemed to have hadjurisdiction—

(a)    in the case of a judgment given in an action inpersonam—

(i)     if the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the original court, submitted to the jurisdiction of that court by voluntarily appearing in the proceedings otherwise than for the purpose of protecting, or obtaining the release of property seized, or threatened with seizure, in the proceedings or of contesting the jurisdiction of that court;or

(ii)    if the judgment debtor was plaintiff in, or counterclaimed in, the proceedings in the original court;or

(iii)    if the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the original court, had before the commencement of the proceedings agreed, in respect of the subject matter of the proceedings, to submit to the jurisdiction of that court or of the courts of the country of that court; or

(iv)   if the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the original court, was at the time when the proceedings were instituted resident in, or being a body corporate had its principal place of business, in the country of that court;or

(b)    in the case of judgment given in an action of which the subject matter was immovable property or in an action in rem of which the subject matter was movable property, if the property in question was at the time of the proceedings in the original court situate in the country of that court;

(c)   in the case of a judgment given in an action other than any such action as is mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, if the jurisdiction of the original court is recognised by the law of the registering court.

(a)    if the subject matter of the proceedings was immovable property outside the country of the original court; or

(b)    except in the case mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (a) and in paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of this section, if the bringing of the proceedings in the original court was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in the courts of the country of that court; or

(2)    Where the registration of a judgment is set aside under subsection (1) of this section, or solely for the reason that the judgment was not at the date of the application for registration enforceable by execution in the country of the original court, the setting aside of the registration shall not prejudice a further application to register the judgment when the appeal has been disposed of or if and when the judgment becomes enforceable by execution in that country as the case may be.

(3)    Where the registration of a judgment is set aside solely for the reason that the judgment, notwithstanding that it had at the date of the application for registration been partly satisfied, was registered for the whole sum payable thereunder, the registering court shall, on application of the judgment creditor, order judgment to be registered for the balance remaining payable at that date.

8.     No proceedings for the recovery of a sum payable under a foreign judgment, being a judgment to which this Part of this Act applies, other than proceedings by way of registration of the judgment, shall be entertained by any court in Nigeria.

(2)    If an order is made under section 3 of this Act extending Part I of this Act to any part of Her Majesty’s dominions to which the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Ordinance extended as aforesaid, the said Act shall cease to have effect in relation to that part of Her Majesty’s dominions, except as regards judgments obtained before the coming into operation of the order and registered in accordance therewith.

(3)    In this section, the expression “any part of the Commonwealth other than Nigeria” shall be deemed to include any British protectorate or protected State and any territory in respect of which a mandate or trusteeship under the League of Nations or United Nations has been accepted by the President.

10.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act—

(a)    a judgment given before the commencement of an order under section 3 of this Act applying Part I of this Act to the foreign country where the judgment was given may be registered within twelve months from the date of the judgment or such longer period as may be allowed by a superior court in Nigeria; and

(b)    any judgment registered under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Ordinance at the time of the coming into operation of an order made under section 3 of this Act in respect of the foreign country where judgment was given shall be treated as if registered under this Act and compliance with the rules applicable to the former Act shall satisfy the requirements of rules made under this Act.

### Part II

Miscellaneous

11.    (1)    Subject to the provisions of this section, a judgment to which Part I of this Act applies or would have applied if a sum of money had been payable thereunder, whether it can be registered or not, and whether, if it can be registered, it is registered or not, shall be recognised in any court in Nigeria as conclusive between the parties thereto in all proceedings founded on the same cause of action and may be relied on by way of defence or counterclaim in any such proceedings.

(2)    This section shall not apply in the case of anyjudgment—

(a)    where the judgment has been registered and the registration thereof has been set aside on some ground otherthan—

(i)     that a sum of money was not payable under the judgment;or

(ii)    that the judgment had been wholly or partly satisfied;or

(iii)    that at the date of the application the judgment could not be enforced by execution in the country of the original court;or

(b)    where the judgment has not been registered and it is shown (whether it could have been registered or not) that if it had been registered the registration thereof would have been set aside on an application for that purpose on some ground other than one of the grounds specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

(3)    Nothing in this section shall be taken to prevent any court in Nigeria recognising any judgment as conclusive of the matter of law or fact decided therein if that judgment would have been so recognised before the passing of this Act.

12.    (1)    If it appears to the Minister of Justice that the treatment in respect of recognition and enforcement accorded by the courts of any foreign country to judgments given in the superior courts of Nigeria is substantially less favourable than that accorded by the courts of Nigeria to judgments of the superior courts of that country, the Minister of Justice may by order apply this section to that country.

(2)    Except in so far as the Minister of Justice may by order under this section otherwise direct, no proceedings shall be entertained in any court in Nigeria for the recovery of any sum alleged to be payable under a judgment given in a court of a country to which this section applies.

(3)    The Minister of Justice may by a subsequent order vary or revoke any order previously made under this section.

13.    Where a judgment under which a sum of money is payable, not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty, has been entered in a superior court in Nigeria against any person and the judgment creditor is desirous of enforcing the judgment in a country or territory to which Part I of this Act applies, the court shall, on an application made by the judgment creditor and on payment of such fee as may be fixed for the purposes of this section by rules of court of the High Court in question, issue to the judgment creditor a certified copy of the judgment, together with a certificate containing such particulars with respect to the action, including the causes of action, and the rate of interest, if any, payable on the sum payable under the judgment, as may be prescribed:

Provided that, where execution of a judgment is stayed for any period pending an appeal or for any other reason, an application shall not be made under this section with respect to the judgment until the expiration of that period.
