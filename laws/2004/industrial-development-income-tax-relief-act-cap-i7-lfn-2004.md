(b)      it is expedient in the public interest to encourage the development or establishment of any industry in Nigeria by declaring the industry to be a pioneer industry and any product of the industry to be a pioneer product, the President may direct publication in the Gazette of a list of such industries and products (in this Act referred to as "the list of pioneer industries and pioneer products") and upon publication as aforesaid, but subject to subsections (5) and (6) of this section, application may at any time thereafter be made under this Act, for the issue of a pioneer certificate to any company in relation to any such pioneer industry or pioneer product, and the President may, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, issue the certificate to the company in any proper case.

(b)      in the case of any other company, is not less than N150,000

(5)      The President may from time to time, on any ground which appears to it sufficient, amend the list of pioneer industries and pioneer products.

5.  Provisions where pioneer certificate operates retrospectively

Subject to the provisions of section 6 of this Act, where a pioneer certificate is to be operative from a retrospective date, then any act or thing which has been done or which has happened for the purposes of the principal Act since that date, but which would not have been done or happened if the pioneer certificate had been in force at that date, shall, whenever necessary for the purposes of this Act and the principal Act, be treated as not having been done or not having happened, and if the act consists of the payment of any tax by a company certified to be a pioneer company, that tax shall, as soon as may be after the expiration of three months from the production day of that company, be repaid to the company by the Board.

6.        Certifying the date of production day and the amount of qualifying capital expenditure, etc.

(1) Not later than one month after the material date, a pioneer company shall make an application in writing to the Director to certify the date of its production day and shall propose a date to be so certified and give reason for proposing that date.

(2)      Not later than one month after the production day of a pioneer company has been finally determined and certified under this section, or within such extended time as the Board may allow, a pioneer company shall make an application in writing to the Board or certify the amount of the qualifying capital expenditure incurred by the pioneer company prior to production day and the company shall supply full particulars of the capital expenditure so incurred.

(3)      In determining the amount of qualifying capital expenditure incurred by a pioneer company prior to its production day, any sum derived directly or indirectly by that company from any disposal (made before that day) of any asset on which qualifying capital expenditure has been incurred shall be taken into account for the purpose of reducing the amount of the qualifying capital expenditure; but where the disposal of such asset is by way of bargain not made at arm's length or is to any person who is controlled by the pioneer company or who has control over the pioneer company, the asset shall be deemed to have been disposed of for an amount, which in the opinion of the Board, the asset would have fetched if sold in the open market at the date of the disposal, less the amount of any expenses which the company might reasonably be expected to incur if the asset were so sold.

(4)      After considering any application made under subsection (1) of this section, together with such further information as he may call for, the Director shall issue a certificate to the pioneer company certifying the date of its production day.

(5)      After considering any application made under subsection (2) of this section, together with such further information as it may call for, the Board shall issue a certificate to the pioneer company certifying the amount of qualifying capital expenditure incurred by the company prior to production day.

(6)      The provisions of Parts IX and X of the principal Act (which relate to objections and appeals) and of any rules made thereunder, shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to any certificate issued by the Director or the Board under this section, as if such certificate were a notice of assessment given under the said provisions of the principal Act.

(7)      The Director shall notify the Minister and the Board of the date of the production day of the pioneer company when the same has been finally determined and certified by the Director.

(8)      When the amount of the qualifying capital expenditure incurred by the pioneer company prior to production day has been finally determined and certified by the Board, the Board shall notify the Minister of that amount.

(9)      On the receipt of the notifications mentioned in subsections (7) and (8) of this section, the Minister shall require the pioneer company to declare within a period not exceeding thirty days in what respects the proposals and estimates made in its application for a pioneer certificate, or any conditions contained in its pioneer certificate, have not been fulfilled.

(10)   Where a certificate issued by the Director under subsection (4) of this section certifies that the date of the production day of a pioneer company is more than one year later than the estimate thereof given in the company's application for a pioneer certificate, the Minister shall report that fact to the President and the President shall cancel the pioneer certificate of that company unless he is satisfied that the delay is due to causes outside the control of the company or to other good and sufficient causes.

(11)   Where a certificate issued by the Board under subsection (5) of this section certifies that    thepioneer company has on or before production day incurred qualifying capital            expenditure of an amount which-

(a)      in the case of an indigenous-controlled company, is less than N50,000; or

(b)      in the case of any other company, is less than N150,000,

the Commissioner shall report that fact to the President and the President shall cancel the pioneer certificate of the company.

(12) For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, "material date" means-

(a)      in relation to a pioneer company engaged in a pioneer industry consisting of the provision of services, the date on which the company is ready to provide such services on a commercial scale; and

(2)      Subject to the provision of this section and without prejudice to section 6 (10) and (11) of this Act, if the Minister is of the opinion that a pioneer company has contravened any provision of this Act or has failed to fulfil any estimate or proposal made in its application for a pioneer certificate or any conditions contained in its pioneer certificate, the Minister shall report the circumstances to the President who may either cancel the pioneer certificate of the company or restrict the tax relief of that company to such period as the President may, notwithstanding the provisions of section 10 of this Act, consider appropriate.

(3)      The effective date of cancellation of a pioneer certificate of a company shall be-

(a)      where the company has been in operation as a pioneer company for a period less than one year after the pioneer date, the pioneer date; and

(b)      where the company has been in operation as a pioneer company for a period of not less than one year after the pioneer date, the date of the last anniversary of the pioneer date, and in this subsection, "the pioneer date" means the date from which a pioneer certificate takes effect.

(4)      Where the pioneer certificate of a pioneer company is cancelled or the tax relief period of a company is restricted under subsection (2) of this section, the Minister shall give notice of the cancellation (specifying the effective date thereof) or of the restriction, to the pioneer company concerned.

11.      Provisions governing old and new trade or business

Where a trade or business of a pioneer company is carried on by the company before and after the end of its tax relief period, then for the purposes of the principal Act and this Act-

(a)      the trade or business of that company shall be deemed to have permanently ceased at the end of the tax relief period of the pioneer company;

13.      Power to direct in certain events

(1)      For the purposes of the principal Act and this Act, the Board may direct that-

(a)      any sums payable to a pioneer company in any accounting period which, but for the provisions of this Act, might reasonably and properly have been expected to have been payable in the normal course of business after the end of that period, shall be treated as not having been payable in that period but as having been payable on such date after that period, as the Board thinks fit, and where such date is after the end of the tax relief period of the pioneer company, as having been so payable on that date as a sum payable in respect of its new trade or business; and

(b)      any expense incurred by a pioneer company within one year after the end of its tax relief period which, but for the provisions of this Act, might reasonably and properly have been expected to have been incurred in the normal course of business during its tax relief period, shall be treated as not having been incurred within that year, but as having been incurred for the purposes of its old trade or business and on such date during its tax relief period, as the Board thinks fit.

(2)      Where a direction has been given under this section with respect to a pioneer company and thereafter the length of the tax relief period of the pioneer company is varied under any of the provisions of this Act, the Board may amend that direction accordingly.

(3)      In determining whether a loss has been made in an accounting period for the purpose of section 10 (6) of this Act, and for that purpose only, the Board may in its absolute discretion exclude such sum as may be in excess of an amount appearing to the Board to be just and reasonably paid or payable by a pioneer company in respect of-

(a)      remuneration to directors of the company;

(b)      interest, service, agency or other similar charges made by a person who is a shareholder  of the company or by a person controlled by such shareholder.

14.      Capital allowances and losses

(1)      The profits of a pioneer company in respect of its old trade or business falling to be ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the principal Act for any accounting period shall be so ascertained, after making any necessary adjustments in consequence of a direction under section 13 of this Act, without any regard to the provisions of sections 20 and 21 of the principal Act.

(2)     Whereany asset is used for the purposes of the new trade or business of a pioneer company, any capital expenditure incurred by the pioneer company in respect of that as- set before the end of its tax relief period shall, for the purposes of the Second Schedule to the principal Act, be deemed to have been incurred on the day next following the end of its tax relief period.

(3)      Where a pioneer company incurs a net loss during an accounting period in its old trade or business, that loss shall be deemed for the purposes of computing total profits (but not profits) to have been incurred by the company on the day on which its new trade or business commences.

(4)      For each accounting period, the Board shall issue to the pioneer company a statement showing the amount of income ascertained under subsection (1) of this section or loss computed in accordance with subsection (3) thereof; and the provisions of Parts IX and X of the principal Act (which relate to objections and appeals) and of any rules made thereunder shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the statement as if such statement were a notice of assessment given under the said provisions of the principal Act.

(5)      For the purposes of subsection (3) of this section, "net loss" means the aggregate of losses incurred during the tax relief period after deduction of profits, if any, made at any time during that period; and a loss shall be computed in the same manner as profits are computed under the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and without regard to the provisions of section 13 (3) of this Act.

15.      Returns of profits

The provisions of Part VIII of the principal Act shall apply in all respects to the prof- its of a pioneer company from its old trade or business as if those profits were chargeable to tax under that Act.

16.      Profits exempted from income tax

(1)      Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section and section 17 (6) of this Act, where in the application of Parts IX and X of the principal Act, a statement is- sued under section 14 (4) of this Act has become final and conclusive, any profits shown by that statement shall not form part of the assessable profits or total profits of the pioneer company for any year of assessment and shall be exempt from tax under the principal Act.

(2)      The Board may, in relation to any statement issued under section 14 (4) of this Act, declare that the whole or a specified part of the profits is not in dispute, and any such undisputed profits shall be exempt from tax under the principal Act pending the statement becoming final and conclusive.

17.      Exemption of certain dividends from income tax

(1)      Wherever any amount of profits of a pioneer company is exempt from tax under section 16 of this Act, that amount shall immediately be credited by the pioneer company to an account to be kept by it for the purposes of this section.

(2)      Where at the date of payment of any dividends by the pioneer company the said account is in credit, the dividends, or so much of the dividends where (after the end of its tax relief period) the amount thereof exceeds such credit, as equal the amount of such credit, shall be debited to the account.

(3)      So much of the amount of any dividends so debited to the account as are received by a shareholder in the pioneer company shall, if the Board is satisfied with the entries in the account, be exempt from tax in the hands of that shareholder and shall for the pur- poses of the principal Act and the Personal Income Tax Act, be deemed to be paid out of profits on which tax is not paid or payable.

[Cap. P8.]

(4)      Any dividends so debited to the account shall be treated as having been distributed to the shareholders or any particular class of shareholders of the pioneer company, in the same proportions as those shareholders were entitled to payment of the dividends giving rise to the debit.

(5)      Whenever called upon so to do by notice in writing sent by the Board to the registered office of a pioneer company, the company shall, until such time as the Board is satisfied that there is no further need for maintaining the account, deliver to the Board a copy of the account made up to a date specified by the Board in the notice.

(6)      Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16 of this Act and of this section, where it appears to the relevant tax authority that any amount of exempted profits of a pioneer company, or any dividend exempted in the hands of a shareholder, ought not to have been exempted by reason of-

(a)      a direction under section 13 of this Act having been made with respect to a  pioneer company, after any profit of that company has been exempted under the provisions of section 16 of this Act; or

(b)      the cancellation of a pioneer certificate, the relevant tax authority may at any time within six years of the direction or cancellation make such additional assessment upon the pioneer company or shareholder as may appear to the relevant tax authority necessary in order to counteract any benefit obtained from the amount which ought not to have been exempted.

(7)      For the purposes of subsection (6) of this section, "relevant tax authority" has the same meaning as in section 2 of the Personal Income Tax Act, and in relation to any additional assessment to be made on a company under the said subsection (6), it means the Board.

[Cap. P8.]

18.      Restrictions on distribution of dividends and on the granting of loans

During its tax relief period, a pioneer company shall not-

(a)      make any distribution to its shareholders, by way of dividend or bonus, in ex- cess of the amount by which the account, to be kept by the company under  section 17 of this Act, is in credit at the date of any such distribution; or

(b)      grant any loan without first obtaining the consent of the Minister, whose con- sent shall only be given if he is satisfied that the pioneer company is obtaining adequate security and a reasonable rate of interest for any such loan.

19.      Exclusion of small companies' relief

A pioneer company shall not be entitled to any relief under section 28 of the principal Act.

20.      Provisions for plantation industry

For the purposes of the principal Act and this Act, the trade of a company which operates a plantation and to which a pioneer certificate has been granted shall be deemed to have commenced on the date when planting first reaches maturity, and any expenditure incurred on the maintenance of a planted area up to that date shall be deemed to have brought into existence an asset, and the expenditure shall be qualifying plantation expenditure for the purposes of the Second Schedule to the principal Act.

23.      Liability under undertaking enforceable notwithstanding proceedings

The institution of proceedings for, or imposition of a fine or term of imprisonment under this Act shall not relieve any person from liability to payment of any sum for which he is or may be liable under any undertaking given by him under any provision of thisAct.

(2)      Subject as aforesaid, and notwithstanding the provisions of section 6 of the Interpretation Act (which relates to the effect of repeals) any pioneer certificate given under the Industrial Development (Income Tax Relief) Act (hereafter in this section referred to as "the repealed Act") by which an industry was declared to be a pioneer industry or a company was declared to be a pioneer company (being a certificate which was in force immediately before the relevant date), shall from that date have effect as if it were a pioneer certificate issued under this Act.

[Cap. I23.]

(3)      Where any part of an initial tax relief period of two years granted to a company before the relevant date under the repealed Act has not expired at the relevant date and the qualifying capital expenditure incurred by the company concerned on or before its production day is-

(a)      in the case of an indigenous-controlled company, not less than N50.000; or

(b)      in the case of any other company, not less than N150.000,

the initial tax relief period shall be construed as if that period were three years instead of two years; and thereafter an application may be made by the company for an extension of the tax relief period under section 10 (2) of this Act.

(4)      Where, in any case other than a case mentioned in subsection (3) of this section, a pioneer certificate granted under the repealed Act to any company is in force immediately before the relevant date, the company may, on or before the expiry date of its pioneer certificate or tax relief period, apply under the provisions of section 10 (2) of this Act, for an extension of its tax relief period; and the provisions of section 1 (4) of this Act shall apply in relation to any application under section 1 of this Act, for the issue of a pioneer certificate.

(5)      A further tax relief period may be granted under section 10 (2) of this Act, to a pioneer company to which subsection (3) or (4) of this section applies, but nothing in this section shall have effect or be construed so as to authorise the grant, in any such case, of a tax relief period (under the repealed Act and this Act) in excess of five years from the production date of the pioneer company.

(6)      Notwithstanding anything in this section, the President may amend or cancel any pioneer certificate to which subsection (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this section applies.

(7)     Where an application for a pioneer certificate made under the repealed Act is pending on the relevant date, the provisions of section 2 of this Act shall apply thereto as if the application had been made under this Act, and the Minister may-

(a)      require the applicant to furnish any particulars, or enter into any undertaking, which if the application had been made under this Act, would have been required to be included in the application or to be given in respect thereto;

(b)      require the applicant to pay the fee prescribed under the said section 2, before the application is proceeded with under this Act.

(8)      Where an application for a pioneer certificate made under the repealed Act has been approved by the President, but no pioneer certificate had been issued in respect thereof, any certificate issued thereafter shall be deemed to have been in force immediately before the relevant date and effect shall be given thereto as if it were a pioneer certificate issued under that Act.
