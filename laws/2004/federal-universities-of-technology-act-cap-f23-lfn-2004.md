(e)      conduct which the Council considers to be generally of such nature as to render the continued appointment or service of the person concerned prejudicial or detrimental to the interest of the University.

(d)      whether to take such lesser disciplinary action against such person (including the restoration of such proportion of his emoluments that might have been withheld) as the Council may determine.

(5)      In any case where the Council, pursuant to this section, decides to continue a person's suspension or decides to take further disciplinary action against a person, the Council shall before the expiration of a period of three months from such decision come to a final determination in respect of the case concerning any such person.
