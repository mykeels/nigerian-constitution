(c)       conduct of a scandalous or other disgraceful nature which the Council considers to be such as to render the person concerned unfit to continue to hold his office; or

(d)      conduct which the Council considers to be such as to constitute failure or inability of the person concerned to discharge the functions of his office or to comply with terms and conditions of his service; or

(e)      conduct which the Council considers to be generally of such nature as to render the continued appointment or service of the person concerned prejudicial or detrimental to the interest of the University.

(4)      Any person suspended pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this section shall be on half pay and the Council shall before the expiration of a period of three months after the date of such suspension consider the case against that person and come to a decision as to--

(a)      whether to continue such person's suspension and if so on what terms (including the proportion. of his emoluments to be paid to him); or

(b)      whether to re-instate such person in which case the Council shall restore his full emoluments with effect from the date of suspension; or

(c)       whether to terminate the appointment of the person concerned in which case such person shall not be entitled to the proportion of his emoluments withheld during the period of suspension; or

(e)      whether to take such lesser disciplinary action against such person (including the restoration of such proportion of his emoluments as might have been withheld) as the Council may determine.

(EDITORIAL NOTE: Numbering as per Gazette. )

(5)      In any case where the Council, pursuant to this section, decides to continue a person's suspension or decides to take further disciplinary action against a person, the Council shall before the expiration of a period of three months from such decision come to a final determination in respect of the case concerning any such person.

(6)      It shall be the duty of the person by whom an instrument of removal is signed in pursuance of subsection (1) of this section to use his best endeavour to cause a copy of the instrument to be served as soon as reasonably practicable on the person to whom it relates.

(7)      Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section shall-
