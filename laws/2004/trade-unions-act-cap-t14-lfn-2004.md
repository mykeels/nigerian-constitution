### PART I — TRADE UNIONS

Registration of trade combinations as Trade Unions

1.     Meaning of “trade union” in this Act.

(1)    In this Act-

“trade unions” means any combination of workers or employers, whether temporary or permanent, the purpose of which is to regulate the terms and combination in question would or would not, apart from this Act, be an unlawful combination by reason of any of its purposes begin in restraint of trade, and whether its purposes do or do not include the provision of benefit for its members.

(2)    The fact that a combination of workers or employers has purposes or powers other than the purpose of regulating the terms and conditions of employment of workers shall not prevent it from being registered under this Act; and accordingly, subject to the provisions of this Act as to the application of funds for political purposes, a trade union may apply its funds for any lawful purpose for the time being authorised by its rules. Including in particular, if so authorised, that of providing benefits for its members.

(3)    A trade union within the meaning of this Act shall not be treated as having been formed by reason only of-

(a)    any agreement between an employer and a person employed by him as to the terms and constitutions of that employment; or

(b)    any agreement for the instruction of any person in a profession, trade or handicraft, or

(c)    any agreement between partners as to their own business or any trading agreement between employers; or

(d)    any agreement imposing restrictions in connection with the sale of the goodwill of a business.

2.     Unregistered trade union prohibited from functioning.

(1)    A trade union shall not perform any act in furtherance of the purposes for which it has been formed unless it has been registered under this Act:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall prevent a trade union from taking any steps (including the collection of subscriptions or dues) which may be necessary for the purpose of getting the union registered.

(2)    Where a trade union registered under this Act ceases to be so registered, it shall not thereafter perform any act in furtherance of its purpose:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall prevent a trade union from taking any steps which may be necessary for the purpose of dissolving the union.

(3)    If any act which is prohibited by subsection (1) or (2) of this section, is performed by a trade union, then-

(a)    the union and every official thereof; and

(b)    any member thereof who, not being an official thereof, took any active part in the performance of that act, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.
