(a)    thepremises where the tank vehicle is kept are secured in such a manner as to prevent the unlawful entry of any person; and

(b)    thevehicle, when garaged on the premises, is protected against interference by an unauthorised person.

84.   An officer authorised by the appropriate authority, or by the Director of Petroleum Resources, or a police officer not below the rank of Inspector may, upon production of evidence of identity, enter any premises where a tank vehicle is usually kept, for the purpose of inspecting such tank vehicle or the premises, or both such vehicle and premises.

85.   A tank vehicle may be parked in a suitable open space or in a yard or building.

86. (1) When loading or unloading a tank vehicle adequate earthing connection from such vehicle shall be made by bonded hose or other means before commencing the operation.

(2)    Suchearthing connection shall not be disconnected until the operation ceases.

(3)    The engine of such vehicle shall be stopped before making such earth connections and shall not be restarted until such earth connections are disconnected: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply where such vehicle is provided with self-pumping equipment driven by a power take-off or a separate power unit which has been approved by the Director of Petroleum Resources.

87.   (1) No unloading of petroleum from any tank vehicle shall take place otherwise than into a licensed storage tank.

(2)    (i)     The provisions of this regulation shall have effect in relation to the transfer of petroleum from the tank of a tank vehicle into a storage tank.

(ii)   For the purpose of distinguishing any storage tank from any other such tank on the same premises every such tank shall be clearly marked by or on behalf of the person licensed under the Act to keep petroleum in the tank (hereafter in this regulation referred to as “the licensee”) with a particular number, and the grade of petroleum contained in the tank shall also be marked thereon, in such manner that the markings cannot be readily altered or obliterated.

(3)  Every dipstick, not being one permanently fixed to a storage tank, and any other device used for ascertaining the quantity of the petroleum spirit for the time being contained in a storage tank, shall in a like manner be marked by or on behalf of the licensee with the same number and grade as that with which the storage tank in connection with which it is used is marked.

(4)  Where the method of filling a storage tank is by means of a pipe leading from the tank to a filling point not situated on, or immediately adjacent to, the tank itself, the said pipe shall in the like manner be clearly marked by or on behalf of the licensee, on or near the filling point, with the same number and grade as that with which the tank is marked.

(5)  Before delivery of petroleum spirit into a storage tank is begun, the licensee shall secure that some competent person who is not the driver of, or any other person employed to be in attendance on, the vehicle from which the delivery is to be made, is in charge of the storage tank for the purpose of the delivery.

(6)  The person in charge of a storage tank shall so far as possible ensure that no petroleum overflows from the storage tank or escapes at the filling point and the tank, and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions of this regulation, shall not permit delivery into that tank to begin—

(a)  unless the tank has immediately before been tested with a dipstick or other suitable device and the test has shown that the quantity of petroleum proposed to be delivered can safely be received by that tank;

(b)  in any case where the method of filling the tank is that referred to in paragraph (4) of this regulation, until he has taken all reasonable steps to secure that the connecting hose through which the petroleum will be delivered is properly and securely connected to the filling point of that tank, and that so far as can be ascertained, all pipes through which the petroleum will pass between the filling point and the tank are properly connected to each other, or as the case may be, to the tank, and are otherwise in good order, and in any other case until he has taken all reasonable steps to secure that the said connecting hose is properly and securely connected to the filling point of the tank; and

(c)   in any case where there is a dipping opening in the storage tank, until the dipping opening has been securely closed, except in a case where the dip and fill pipe are combined.

(7)  Proper records shall be kept of all deliveries into every storage tank.

### Part VI

Liquefied Petroleum Gases

88.  In this Part of these Regulations, the precautions to be observed in the handling and storage of liquefied petroleum gases are additional to those in any other regulations relating to class “A” petroleum and such other regulations shall be read accordingly.

89.  (1)Subjectto the prior approval in writing of the Director-General, the appropriate authority may issue licences for the importation of liquefied petroleum gases and for their storage at bulk installations and depots.

(2)   No liquefied petroleum gases may be imported, and no bulk installations or depots for such gases may be operated, without such a licence.

(3)  All such licences shall expire on the 31st December of the year in which they are issued.

90.  (1)       Tanks for the storage of liquefied petroleum gases shall be designed for a working pressure corresponding to the vapour pressure at the highest temperature that the contents of the tanks are likely to reach.

(2) The storage tanks shall be fitted with one or more spring-loaded pressure relief valves which communicate directly with the vapour spaces of the tanks and the total discharge capacity of the pressure relief valves on each storage tank shall be such that it limits the pressure inside the tank to 120% of the design pressure under any conditions.

(3)   A shut-off valve shall not be installed between a pressure relief valve and storage tank, except in cases where two or more relief valves are fitted to one tank and the shut-off valves are interlocked so that when one is shut the other is fully open and in any such cases the discharge capacity of the relief valve or valves open to the tank shall meet the requirements of paragraph (2) of this regulation; and if it is found impracticable to interlock shut-off valves as in the case where safety-relief valves may be locked in the open position by means of padlocks, the keys of the padlocks shall be retained by a responsible member of the staff who shall ensure that only one shut-off valve is closed at one time.

(4)  All safety valves shall be fitted with vent pipes discharging vertically upwards at a minimum height of six feet above the tank top; and the vent pipes shall be fitted with loose-fitting rain caps and be drained at the bottom, the drain holes being located so as not to permit impingement of vapour or liquid on the surface of the storage tank.

(5)  Each storage tank shall be fitted with a pressure gauge and devices for measuring the liquid content and its temperature; and the maximum quantity of liquefied petroleum gas filled into any one tank shall be such that at the maximum operating temperature it will not occupy more than 98% of the capacity of the storage tank.

(6)  Drain-cocks or other shut-off valves which communicate direct with the outer atmosphere shall be fitted with caps or blank flanges in which a hole having a maximum diameter of one eighth of an inch shall be drilled, thereby restricting the flow from the valve and minimising the danger caused by careless operation.

(7)  Storage tanks shall be painted in light colours.

(8)  No storage tank shall be filled with liquefied petroleum gas having a vapour pressure greater than that of the petroleum product for which the tank is designed.

91. (1) Pipeline layouts for use with storage tanks shall be suitably constructed according to recognised practice, with pipelines, valves and pipe fittings conforming to sound engineering practices and cast-iron valves and fittings shall on no account be used.

(2)  Where it is possible for any liquefied petroleum gas in its liquid phase to be trapped between two valves, a pressure relief valve shall be fitted notwithstanding that the space between the valves may be equipment such as a pump casing of a meter.

(3)  Excess flow valves shall be fitted as necessary to prevent the loss of liquefied petroleum gases from storage tanks and transport tanks, and especially to protect points where flexible hoses are used.

(4)  Remote controlled hydraulically operated shut-valves shall be fitted to each storage tank.

92.  (1) Containers shall be filled with liquefied petroleum gases only in buildings reserved exclusively for these products; and the floors of such buildings, which shall have a non-sparking surface, shall be at ground level or raised platform height.

If raised to platform height, the space under the platform may be left open on all sides to allow free ventilation or may be filled in. The space, if left open, shall not be used for any purpose other than ventilation and shall be kept free from rubbish. Pits in the floor shall be filled in solid to obviate the danger of gas accumulation and drains shall be provided with a gas-liquid separator situated outside the building.

(2)  Filled containers shall not be stored in the container-filling bay. If it is essential that the same structure be used for storage and filling, fire-proof wells shall be installed to separate the two operations.

(3)  Container filling operations shall be carried out at least 75 feet from any open fire and not less than fifty feet from any storage tanks and installation boundary, or in respect of any other petroleum product at the like distance from any filling shed or storage shed.

93.  (1) The quantity of liquefied petroleum gas to be filled in any container shall not occupy more than 95% of the total capacity at a temperature of 65 °C or 150 °F.

(2)  All containers shall be completely emptied before refilling.

(3)  After filling a container, all valves shall be tested to ensure that they are free from leaks.

(4)   No containers shall be vented to the atmosphere of the filling shed, and if it is necessary to vent the contents of a full or partially full container, it shall be removed to a safe place for this purpose:

Provided that a suitable vent line may be connected to carry the vented gases away from the filling shed for dispersal in a safe place.

(5)       Before filling the containers they shall be visually inspected for damage caused by denting or corrosion and for faulty valves; and they shall also be checked to make sure that they are of a type suitable for the particular product it is proposed to fill into them.

94.  (1) Every reasonable precaution shall be taken to ensure that valves and fittings on containers are in sound condition and that the containers are free from water, air or foreign matter; and inspection of empty containers shall include a check on weight and an examination of the name-plate to confirm the rating to be correct to specification for the proposed filling ratio.

(2)  When valves are found to be in the open position or in a damaged condition, special ventilation measures shall be taken to remove any gas, air or moisture present in the container.

(3)  Full containers shall be inspected by checking the weight and testing the container valves, and on completion of the inspection the valves shall be sealed.

(4)  A suitable arrangement shall be provided to enable containers to be safely vented should it be necessary to reduce the contents or to effect repairs.

(5)  Relief valves shall be fitted in the filling line at any point where liquid may be trapped between closed valves. Discharge from relief valves shall not vent to atmosphere inside buildings.

95.  (1)      Containers shall be handled with great care at all times and if the valve protective cover is detachable, it shall be replaced when the container is not in use.

(2)  Lubricants and jointing compounds shall be resistant to liquefied petroleum gas, water and heat.

(3)  When containers are not in use, outlet valves shall be kept tightly closed even if the containers are considered to be empty.

(4)  At intervals not exceeding five years, containers shall be hydraulically tested to one and a half times the working pressure and the date of the last test, the number of the container and the test pressure shall be painted on the container and recorded in a log book kept for that purpose by the licensee.

96.  (1)       Valves, unions and hoses used for container filling shall be resistant to the solvent action of liquefied petroleum gases; and they shall be designed for a bursting pressure of five times the maximum pressure they will have to carry in service.

(2)  The hoses shall be provided with a union for attachment to the supply pipe and a quick-closing valve at the end to which the container is coupled; and the hoses, complete with unions and valves, shall be examined visually daily and tested hydraulically at monthly intervals, to twice their working pressure.

97.  All filling points, lines and connections, shall be electrically bonded and earthed, and the resistance of the earth shall not exceed ten ohms.

98.  (1) Dry-powder fire extinguishers shall be kept readily available for use in connection with any liquefied petroleum gas installation in case of fire.

(2)  Installations shall be provided with a water supply for fire-fighting and gas storage tanks shall be fitted with water spray system utilising “fog nozzles” or similar devices.

### Part VII
