(3)      Where an enactment is expressed to come into force on a particular day, it shall be construed as coming into force immediately on the expiration of the previous day.

3.        Punctuation, headings and descriptive words

4.        Amended and substituted enactment

(b)      any reference to the repealed enactment shall, after the substituted enactment comes into force, be construed as a reference to the substituted enactment;
