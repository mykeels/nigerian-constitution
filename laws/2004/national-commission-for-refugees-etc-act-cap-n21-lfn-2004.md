(3)    he has acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the protection of the country of his new nationality; or

(4)    he has voluntarily re-established himself in the country which he left or outside which he remained, owing to fear of persecution; or

(5)    he can no longer, because the circumstances in connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality:

Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A (1) of this Article, who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the country of nationality;

D.     This Convention shall not apply to persons who are at present receiving from organs or agencies of the United Nations, other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, protection or assistance.
