(b)    a representative of the Federal Ministry of Industry;

(c)    the chairman or a representative of the National Salaries, Income, Wages Commission;

(d)    the Chief Statistician of the Federation;

(e)    six representatives of the States as nominated by the Governor of the State concerned and appointed by the Minister for two years, so however that each State is sometime represented on the Board and that no two of them shall come from the same State;

(f)     one representative of consumers' associations in Nigeria; and

(g)    two representatives from outside the civil services of the Federation or of the States.

(2)    The members of the Board under paragraphs (f) and (g) of subsection (1) of this section shall be appointed by the Minister with the approval of the President and shall hold office on such terms and on such conditions as the Minister may with the like approval determine.

(3)    There shall be an Executive Secretary to the Board who shall be a public officer in the Federal Ministry of Commerce.

2.     Price Control Committees

(1)    There shall continue to be for each State a Committee to be known as the Price Control Committee.

(2)    The Committee in each State shall consist of-

(a)    the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Trade and Industries of the State, who shall be chairman of the Committee and State Price Controller;

(b)    the Commissioner of Police for the State, or his representative;

(c)    the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of  Information of the State, or his representative; and

(d)    two other persons to be appointed by the State Commissioner for Trade and Industries.

(3)    The representative in the State of the Federal Ministry of Commerce, shall be the secretary to the Committee.

(4)    It shall be the principal function of the Committee to advise and assist the Board on the implementation of this Act in the State for which the Committee is established.

(5)    If in any State any office mentioned in subsection (2) above does not exist, the paragraph in question shall be construed as referring to the office which in the opinion of the Governor most nearly corresponds to the office so mentioned.

3.     Provisions supplemental to sections 1 and 2

(1)    Subject to any directions given by the Minister, the Board and each Committee may fix its own quorum and otherwise regulate its own procedure.

(2)    There may be paid to the members of the Board or any Committee, not being members who are public officers, such remuneration and allowances (if any) as the Minister may decide.

(3)    The validity of any proceedings of the Board or a Committee shall not be affected by-

(a)    any vacancy in its membership;

(b)    any defect in the appointment of any member; or

(c)    the fact that a person not entitled to do so took part in the proceedings.

Imposition of price control, offences, etc.

4.     Imposition of price control

(1)    Price control shall continue to be imposed in accordance with this Act on any goods which are of the kind specified in the First Schedule to this Act.

(2)    The Board may by order add any goods to the said First Schedule or delete any goods therefrom.

5.     Fixing of controlled price

(1)    The Board may by notice published in the Federal Gazette-

(a)    fix a basic price for any controlled commodity in accordance with subsection (2) of this section; and

(b)    fix the permitted variation for the commodity in respect of any State in accordance with subsection (3) of this section.

(2)    The basic price is the price which in the opinion of the Board properly represents-

(a)    in the case of goods produced in Nigeria, the cost of production of the commodity plus the manufacturer's profit; and

(b)    in the case of imported goods, the duty-paid landed cost in Nigeria plus the importer's profit.

(3)    The permitted variation, in relation to any particular commodity, is the amount representing transport and other costs plus the distributor's profit which in the opinion of the Board ought properly to be added to the basic price in order to represent a fair controlled price (wholesale or retail, as the case may be) in any State.

6.     Prohibition of sale above controlled price

(1)    If shall be unlawful for any person to sell, agree to sell or offer to sell any or employ any other person, whether or not that other person is of full age, to sell any controlled commodity at a price which exceeds the controlled price.

(2)    If any person contravenes subsection (1) of this section in respect of any controlled commodity-

(a)    he shall be guilty of an offence and shall-

(i)     in the case of a retailer, be liable to a fine of not less than N200 and not more than N2,000 or to imprisonment for not less than six months, or to both such fine and imprisonment; and

(ii)    in the case of a manufacturer, wholesaler or major distributor, be liable to a fine of not less than N 1,000 and not more than N10,000, or to imprisonment for not less than twelve months, or to both such fine and imprisonment; and

(b)    the stock of the controlled commodity shall be liable to forfeiture.

(3)    Where a person is convicted of any offence under subsection (2) of this section in respect of any commodity the court shall make an order forfeiting the stock of the commodity; and, where such an order is made, the commodity shall be disposed of by the Board as it thinks fit, any proceeds of the disposal being paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation.

(4)    Where proceedings under subsection (2) of this section do not result in conviction the court shall make an order for the disposal at the controlled price of any commodity to which the proceedings relate and the proceeds of such disposal shall be applied as follows-

(a)    ninety per cent of the proceeds shall be paid to the owner of the commodity;

(b)    the remaining ten per cent shall be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation.

(5)    For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section where any person employed by another to sell any controlled commodity is proved to have sold the commodity at any price which exceeds the controlled price, the employer of that person shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law or rule of law, be deemed to have employed that other person to sell the commodity concerned at the price at which it was in fact sold.

7.    Hoarding

(i)     refuses to sell the commodity in question, or denies that he (or, as the case may be, his employer) has the commodity, or uses any words or gives any other indication calculated to lead the buyer to suppose that he (or, as the case may be, his employer) has not got the commodity or will not or cannot sell it; or

(ii)    offers to sell the commodity subject to a condition requiring the buying of any other goods (whether controlled commodities or not) or the making of any payment in respect of any service, or subject to any other condition except delivery within a reasonable time, the person carrying on the business shall be guilty of an offence.

(2)    It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) of this section in respect of any controlled commodity to prove that the sale of the commodity, or the sale of the commodity without the fulfillment of a condition proposed by him or his employee, would, having regard to the quantity of the commodity which he or his employee was requested to sell or any other consideration, involve a breach of some written and duly stamped contractual obligation lawfully binding on him, which obligation must be to an approved institution.

(b)    the remaining ten per cent shall be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation.

8.     Resale price maintenance

(1)    The Minister may on the recommendation of the Board and in relation to any commodity, including any commodity in respect of which price control is imposed under this Act, by order approve any resale price maintenance agreement or arrangement entered into by the manufacturer, importer or distributor of that commodity on the one hand, and the seller (whether a wholesaler or retailer) of that commodity on the other.

(2)    An order under subsection (1) of this section shall specify the commodity to which the approved resale price maintenance agreement or arrangement relates and the maximum price at which the commodity affected is to be sold under the agreement or arrangement.
