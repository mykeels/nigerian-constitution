(3)     In determining any application under this section, the Board shall have regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case, and in particular shall consider whether the granting of relief would result in the exclusion from charge to tax of any part of the profits of the company, and for this purpose the Board may take into consideration the liability of the company and assessments made upon it in respect of other years.

(b)     such profits mean profits in respect of the trade or business in which there was used an asset in connection with which such allowance or charge falls to be made:

Provided that, in the case of any such trade or business‐

(i)      where two basis periods overlap, the period common to both shall be deemed, except for the purpose of making an annual allowance, to fall in the basis period ending at the earlier date and in no other basis period;

(ii)     where two basis periods coincide, they shall be treated as overlapping, and the basis period for the earlier year of assessment shall be treated as ending before the end of the basis period for the later year of assessment;

(iii)    wherethere is an interval between the end of the basis period for one year of assessment and the basis period for the next year of assessment, then unless the second‐mentioned year of assessment is the year in which, for the purposes of subsection (4) of section 29, such company permanently ceases to carry on the trade or business, the interval shall be deemed to be part of the second basis period; and

(iv)    wherethere is an interval between the end of the basis period for the year of assessment preceding that in which the trade or business permanently ceases, for the purposes of subsection (4) of section 29, to be carried on by such company and the basis period for the year in which it so ceases, the interval shall be deemed to form part of the first basis period;

"concession" includes a mining right and a mining lease;

"lease" includes an agreement for a lease where the term to be covered by the lease has begun, any tenancy and any agreement for the letting or hiring out of an asset, but does not include a mortgage, and the expression "leasehold interest" shall be construed accordingly and‐

(a)     where, with the consent of the lessor, a lease of any asset remains in possession thereof after the termination of the lease without a new lease being granted to him, that lease shall be deemed for the purposes of this Schedule to continue so long as he remains in possession as aforesaid; and

(b)     where, on the termination of a lease of any asset, a new lease of that asset is granted to the lessee, the provisions of this Schedule shall have effect as if the second lease were a continuation of this first lease;

(iv)    onthe acquisition of, or of rights in or over, the deposits or on the purchase of information relating to the existing and extent of the deposits;

(i)      expenditure is incurred for the purposes of a trade or business by a company about to carry on such trade or business; and

(ii)     that expenditure is incurred in respect of an asset owned by that company if that expenditure would have fallen to be treated as qualifying expenditure if it had been incurred by that company on the first day on which it carries on that trade or business, that expenditure shall be deemed to be qualifying expenditure incurred by it on that day;

(f)      capital expenditure, that is, qualifying research and development expenditure, incurred on equipment and facilities, patents, licences, secret formula or process or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific process; technical feasibility of products or processes and purchases, searching for and discovering and testing products or process for future market or use; and such other similar cost which has not brought into existence any asset;

4.      Sale of buildings

Where capital expenditure has been incurred on the construction of a building, structure or works and thereafter the relevant interest therein is sold, any company which buys that interest shall be deemed, for all the purposes of this Schedule except the granting of initial allowances, to have incurred, on the date when the purchase price became payable, capital expenditure on the construction thereof equal to the price paid by it for such interest or to the original cost of construction whichever is the less:

Provided that where such relevant interest is sold before the building, structure or works has been used, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall have effect with respect to such sales with the omission of the words "except the granting of initial allowances" and the original cost of construction shall be taken to be the amount of the purchase price on such sale:

1.      As regards Nigeria:

Subject to the provisions of the laws of Nigeria regarding the allowances as a credit against Nigerian tax or tax payable in a territory outside Nigeria (which shall not affect the general principle hereof)‐

(a)     French tax payable under laws or France and in accordance with this Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within France (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out or which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any Nigerian tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which French tax is computed;

(b)     in case of a dividend paid by a company which is a resident or France to a company which is resident in Nigeria and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account (in addition to any French tax for which credit may be allowed under the provisions or sub‐paragraph (a) or this paragraph) the French tax payable by the company in respect or the profits out of which such dividend is paid.

2.      In the case of France:

Profits and other positive income arising in Nigeria and which are taxable in that State in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, may also be taxed in France where such income is received by a resident of France. The Nigerian tax shall not be deductible in France for the computation of taxable income. But the beneficiary shall be entitled to a tax credit against French tax in the basis of which such income is included.

Such credit shall be equal‐

(a)     in the case of income referred to in Articles 10, 11, 12, 13 and 22, to the amount paid in Nigeria in accordance with the provisions or these Articles.

However, it shall not exceed the amount of French tax attributable to such income.

(b)     in the case of other income to the amount or French tax attributable to such income this provision shall also apply to remuneration referred to in Article 18.

ARTICLE 24

Non‐discrimination

1.       Notwithstanding the provisions or Article 1, nationals of a Contracting Stale shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other Contracting State in the same circumstances are or may he subjected.

2.      The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises or that other State carrying on the same activities.

3.      Enterprises of a Contracting State. the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly by one or more residents of the other Contracting Stale, shall not be subjected in the first‐mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirement to which other similar enterprises of the first‐mentioned State are or may be subjected.

4.      Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either Contracting State to grant to individuals not resident in that State any or the personal allowances, reliefs and deductions for tax purposes, which are granted to individuals as resident.

5.      The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description.

ARTICLE 25

The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.

2.      The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall he implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.

3.      The competent authorities of the States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application to the Agreement.

Exchange of information

1.      The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Agreement in so far as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that contracting State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment, or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Agreement. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes.

2.      In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article be construed so as to impose on one of the Contracting States the obligation‐

(a)     to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other State;

(b)     to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of  that or of the other Contracting State;

In such case the provisions of Article 4 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

5.      Where a company which is a resident of one of the States derives profits or income from the other State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.

5.      The provisions of paragraphs 1and 2 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the debt claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

6.      Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last‐mentioned amount.

CHAPTER IV

Elimination of double taxation

ARTICLE 23

Elimination of double taxation

1.      The Netherlands, when imposing tax on its residents, may include in the basis upon which such taxes are imposed the items of income which, according to the provisions of this Agreement, may be taxed in Nigeria.

2.      However, where a resident of the Netherlands derives items of income which according to Article 6, Article 7, paragraph 4 of Article 10, paragraph 5 of Article 11; paragraph 4 of Article 12, paragraphs I and 2 of Article 13, Article 14, Article IS, Article 16 and Article 19 of this Agreement may be taxed in Nigeria and are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1, the Netherlands shall exempt such items of income by allowing a reduction of its tax. This reduction shall be computed in conformity with the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. For that purpose the said items of income shall be deemed to be included in the total amount of the items of income which are exempt from Netherlands lax under this provision.

3.      Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraph 2 at" Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11, paragraph 2 of Article 12, paragraph 4 of Article 13, Article 17, sub‐paragraph (a) of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of Article 18 and paragraph 2 of Article 22 of this Agreement may be taxed in Nigeria to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. The amount of this deduction shall be equal to the tax paid in Nigeria on these items of income, but shall not exceed the amount of the reduction which would be allowed if the items of income so included were the sole items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation.

Where by reason of the relief given under the provisions of Nigerian laws for the purposes of encouraging investment in Nigeria the Nigeria tax actually levied on interest arising in Nigeria or on royalties arising in Nigeria is lower than the tax Nigeria may levy according to paragraph 2 of Article 11 and paragraph 2 of Article 12, respectively, then the amount of the tax paid in Nigeria on such interest and royalties shall be deemed to have been paid at the rates mentioned in the said provisions.

However, if the general tax rates under Nigerian laws applicable to the aforementioned interest and royalties are reduced below those mentioned in this paragraph, those lower rates shall apply for the purposes of this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply for a period of ten years after the date on which the Agreement became effective. This period may be extended by mutual agreement between the competent authorities.

4.      Subject to the provisions of the law of Nigeria regarding the allowance as a credit against Nigerian tax or tax payable in a territory outside Nigeria (which shall not affect the general principle hereof‐

(a)     Netherlands tax payable under laws of the Netherlands and in accordance with this Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within the Netherlands (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any Nigerian tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which Netherlands tax is computed;

(b)     in case of a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of the Netherlands to a company which is resident in Nigeria and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account (in addition to any Netherlands tax for which credit may be allowed under the provisions of sub‐paragraph (a) of this paragraph) the Netherlands tax payable by the company in respect of the profits out of which such dividend is paid.

For the purposes of this Article in determining the taxes on income paid to the Netherlands, the investment premiums and bonuses and disinvestments payments as meant in the Netherlands Investment Account Law ("Wet investeringsrekening") shall not be taken into account as they do not form part of the taxes referred to in paragraphs I (a) and 2 of Article 2.

CHAPTER V

The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.

2.      The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement.

3.      The competent authorities of the States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application to the Agreement.

IV. AD ARTICLE 9

It is understood that the fact that associated enterprises have concluded arrangements, such as cost‐sharing arrangements or general services agreements, for or based on the allocation of executive, general administrative, technical and commercial expenses, research and development expenses and other similar expenses, is not in itself a condition as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9. However, this does not prevent one of the States from checking the above‐mentioned arrangements for conditions as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9.

V. AD ARTICLES 10, 11 AND 12

(i)      The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of the reductions and exemptions from tax in the State of source given by Articles 10, 11 and 12.

(ii)     Where tax has been levied at source in excess of the amount of tax chargeable under the provisions of Articles 10, 11 and 12, applications for refund of the excess amount of tax have to be lodged with the competent authority of the State having levied the tax, within a period of three years after the expiration of the calendar year in which the tax has been levied.

VI. AD ARTICLE 13

It is understood that the terms corporate organisation, reorganisation, amalgamation, division or similar transaction refer to a transfer of shares within a group of associated enterprises.

In that case the shares will be evaluated for the transferee at the book value of the transferor.

VII. AD ARTICLE 16

It is understood that "bestuurdet" or "commissaris" of a Netherlands company means persons who are nominated as such by the general meeting of shareholders or by any other competent body of such company and are charged with the general management of the company or the supervision thereof respectively.
