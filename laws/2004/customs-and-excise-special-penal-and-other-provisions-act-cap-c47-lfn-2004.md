(3)    The reference in subsection (2) of this section to departments of the Government of the Federation or of a State shall be construed as including a reference to any body, whether corporate or unincorporate, directly established by an enactment and any company in respect of which the Government of the Federation or of a State has controlling or substantial interest.
